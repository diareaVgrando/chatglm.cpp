The pack features primarily guitar tones, but also includes a selection of bass settings for a complete sonic package. The tones are inspired by some of the most genre-defining albums and bands of death metal, such as Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dissection, Entombed, In Flames, At the Gates, Decapitated, Arch Enemy, Morbid Angel and more. You can easily tweak the tones to your liking using the simple interface of EZmix 2, or just use them as they are for instant results.
 
The tones are based on amp modeling, IRs and stomp box modeling, giving you a realistic and authentic sound that can rival any real amp or pedal. Whether you need a brutal rhythm tone, a shredding lead tone, or a clean tone with some crunch, you will find it in this pack. The pack also covers different subgenres of death metal, such as Swedish death metal, technical death metal, melodic death metal and more.
 
The Death Metal Guitars EZmix Pack is a must-have for any death metal producer or guitarist who wants to add some heaviness and aggression to their music. It is compatible with any DAW that supports VST, AU or AAX plugins, and works seamlessly with EZdrummer 2 or Superior Drummer 3 for a complete drum and guitar production solution. You can get it for only $39 from Toontrack's website or from any authorized dealer.
